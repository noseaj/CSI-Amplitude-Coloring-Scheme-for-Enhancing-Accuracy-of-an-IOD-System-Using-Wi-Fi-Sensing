## Experiments

We install the Nexmon CSI tool on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a single Wi-Fi receiving antenna to capture CSI. And we use an ESP8266 as the Wi-Fi transmitter to send Wi-Fi frames using only one transmitting antenna on the narrowest 20 MHz Wi-Fi channel.

**CSI measurement environments (Tx represents a Wi-Fi transmitter, and Rx represents a CSI receiver).**
